# Quiz App

This is a simple quiz app built with React. It fetches questions from a local js file and displays them to the user. The user can select an answer and move to the next question. The app also keeps track of the user's score.

## Usage

The app displays a question to the user with four possible answers. The user can select an answer by clicking on it. The app will display the next question and keep track of the user's score. After the user has answered all the questions, the app will display the user's final score.
